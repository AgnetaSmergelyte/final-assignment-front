# Project Overview

## Front-End:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Seamless navigation and dynamic page rendering made using React-Router.

Efficient data flow across components and consistent state management implemented by Redux.

Responsive Mobile First Web Design enhanced with SCSS.

## Back-End:

Server has been powered by Node.js, a runtime environment known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for scalable applications.

Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, was used to build the server's API endpoints and handle middleware.

Data storage and management is handled using MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability.

User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, ensuring data protection and security.

Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and efficient user authorization, allowing for protected routes and actions.

The platform supports real-time interactions using Socket.io for instant messaging and live post updates.
